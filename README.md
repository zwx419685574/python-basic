The Zen of Python
    Beautiful is better than ugly.
    Explicit is better than implicit.
    Simple is better than complex.
    Complex is better than complicated.
    Flat is better than nested.
    Sparse is better than dense.
    Readability counts.
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
    Although practicality beats purity.
    Errors should never pass silently.
    Unless explicitly silenced.
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
    Now is better than never.
    Although never is often better than *right* now.
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
    
 优美胜于丑陋，明晰胜于隐晦
    简单胜于复杂，复杂胜于繁芜
    扁平胜于嵌套，稀疏胜于密集
    可读性很重要。
    虽然实用性比纯粹性更重要，
    但特例并不足以把规则破坏掉。

    错误状态永远不要忽略，
    除非你明确地保持沉默，
    直面多义，永不臆断。

    最佳的途径只有一条，然而他并非显而易见————谁叫你不是荷兰人？

    置之不理或许会比慌忙应对要好，
    然而现在动手远比束手无策更好。

    难以解读的实现不会是个好主意，
    容易解读的或许才是。

    名字空间就是个顶呱呱好的主意。

    让我们想出更多的好主意！
