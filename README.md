The Zen of Python<br>
    Beautiful is better than ugly.<br>
    Explicit is better than implicit.<br>
    Simple is better than complex.<br>
    Complex is better than complicated.<br>
    Flat is better than nested.<br>
    Sparse is better than dense.<br>
    Readability counts.<br>
    Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.<br>
    Although practicality beats purity.<br>
    Errors should never pass silently.<br>
    Unless explicitly silenced.<br>
    In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br>
    There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br>
    Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br>
    Now is better than never.<br>
    Although never is often better than *right* now.<br>
    If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br>
    If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.<br>
    Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!<br>
    
 优美胜于丑陋，明晰胜于隐晦<br>
    
    简单胜于复杂，复杂胜于繁芜
    扁平胜于嵌套，稀疏胜于密集
    可读性很重要。
    虽然实用性比纯粹性更重要，
    但特例并不足以把规则破坏掉。

    错误状态永远不要忽略，
    除非你明确地保持沉默，
    直面多义，永不臆断。

    最佳的途径只有一条，然而他并非显而易见————谁叫你不是荷兰人？

    置之不理或许会比慌忙应对要好，
    然而现在动手远比束手无策更好。

    难以解读的实现不会是个好主意，
    容易解读的或许才是。

    名字空间就是个顶呱呱好的主意。

    让我们想出更多的好主意！
